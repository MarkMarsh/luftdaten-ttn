# Write data from basic Luftdaten Sensors to TTN

Instead of using WiFi to transfer air quality data to Luftdaten (https://luftdaten.info/) we're going to first transfer it to The Things Network and then on to Luftdaten. This allows the sensors to be placed where there is no WiFi signal. 

This is a first stab at the transfer to TTN code.
